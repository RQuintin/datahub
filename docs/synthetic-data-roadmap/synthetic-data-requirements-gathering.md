### Requirements Gathering Approach

The following items describe the steps needed to gather the Synthetic Data requirements for DataHub and DataHelix.

1. Synthetic Data Requirements Obtained and Available in DataHub GitHub

2. Understand user stories of the clients who need a synthetic data solution or have a synthetic data problem.

3. Establish where the documentation should live and the relationship between projects

4. Contact FINOS project teams and understand their Synthetic Data requirements. The first project being [Morphir](https://github.com/finos/morphir) and then [Alloy](https://github.com/finos/alloy).

5. Direct / Influence DataHub and DataHelix roadmap based on input from the team.
