# Synthetic Data Architecture

__Status:__ Draft

## Problem

Synthetic data is a complex subject with many approaches and moving parts, to scale as an opensource project FINOS synthetic generators should be modular, single responsibility and clearly fit into a subset of the synthetic-workflow. For this to happen each part of the synthetic process should have a clearly defined specification/API and set of protocols the elements can work over.

## Outcomes

* [[Link](./outcomes/standard-pipeline-process.md)] Declare a typical synthetic-data pipeline process
* [[Link](./outcomes/specification-standards.md)] Declare modules and specification standards
