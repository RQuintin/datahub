# Decision to integrate DataHelix and DataHub

__Status:__ Draft

## Problem

It's recognized that the DataHelix JSON configuration specification enables the quick creation of data for engineering teams, while the DataHub library-based approach allowed engineers to get in and easily extend, customize and produce more complex models.

DataHub (Python) and DataHelix (Java) are based on different underlying technologies. DataHub chose Python due to its status as the defacto 'data science' language of choice and wealth of existing libraries. In addition, Python was selected due to its portability, interoperability and that it can run on nearly any platform with minimum setup requirements.

DataHelix is Java-based, Java is a non-controversial choice well supported and a wealth of experienced developers.
