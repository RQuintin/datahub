## Abstract

This outcome is to decide if we need a single, extensible specification language that can be used to drive an API and possibly a UI.

DataHelix has an already established 'JSON' spec for declaring data profiles - the purpose of this profile markup is to declare a high-level spec, which DataHelix's core engine can use to produce the synthetic set.
