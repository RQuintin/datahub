              Using the core library to synthetically
              generate data requires direct scripting/coding.
              Many usecases could be catered for by a UI workflow

              An agent-based model (ABM) is a class of computational models for
              simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents
              (both individual or collective entities such as organizations
              or groups) with a view to assessing their effects on the
              system as a whole
