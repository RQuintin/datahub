DataHub is a python library which helps you to produce synthetic datasets.
DataHub has a slant towards financial services, but for the most it is generic.

The core library is un-opinionated as to what you do with the generated data - it
simply gives you a pandas dataframe or an object list - what you do with that
dataset is up to you, Pandas for example has a vast array of support for persisitng
dataframes. That said, we are working on service and UI capabilities which of course
will persist data. Keep track of that effort and your contribution is welcomed. The core library will however remain as vanilla and un-opinionated as possible.

Many of the features of DataHub are drawn from existing python libraies dedicated
to some facet of synthetic generation - DataHub while offering allot of it's
own functionality directly pulls in other libraries where applicable - See
Thanks To and the full dependency list.

## Overview of Synthetic data

- Synthetic data is information that's is artificially manufactured rather than
  generated by *real-world events.
- Synthetic data is created algorithmically, and can be used as a stand-in for
  test datasets of production data
- **Real data** does play a part in synthetic data generation - depending on how
realistic you want the output

### Problem

- A lack of useful test data hampers the development of new systems.
Cloning production data (if it exists) creates significant risks requiring
continued management with the headache of redacting PII data and continued
Compliance / Information Security oversight

- Sharing data with potential partners is problematic and data redaction
is not always the ideal solution as distributions in the data are still
exposed and is not friendly to work with – Anonymization is an expensive
involved process

### Alternatives

- Random Data generators and redactors just aren’t that useful.
- Simulation software that generates  datasets are domain specific
- Commercial alternatives have  closed build/tool-chains in domains with little crossover

## History

DataHub started in Citi's E4 program (Engineering Excellence 4), Citigroup's
highest engineering excellence training program.
Candidates pitch projects to the E4 faculty and Senior management. Out of the
submissions several projects are selected, the select project must be executed in
the 6 month time frame as an individual contribution by the developer.

DataHub originated from the 3rd iteration of the program in 2019, and subsequently
taken up by Citi's Innovation Lab.
