![DataHub logo](docs/logo.png) __Synthetic data generation__

DataHub is a set of python libraries dedicated to the production of synthetic data to be used in tests, machine learning training, statistical analysis, and other use cases https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_data. DataHub uses existing datasets to generate synthetic models. If no existing data is available it will use user-provided scripts and data rules to generate synthetic data using out-of-the-box helper datasets.
Synthetic datasets are simply artificiality manufactured sets, produced to a desired degree of accuracy. Real Data does play a part in synthetic generation, all depending on the realism you require. The product roadmaps details out the functionality planned in this respect. 
DataHub's core is predominantly based around pandas data frames and object generation.
A common question: Now that I have a data frame of synthetic-data, what do I do with it? The Pandas library comes with an array of options here - so for the time being sinking to databases is out of the scope of the core library, however see that examples in the test folder for some common patterns. 
**note** As we build out a config based synthetic spec generator, we will bring this back into scope - please see our roadmap/issue list and get involved in the discussion.

## Overview of Synthetic data

- Synthetic data is information that's is artificially manufactured rather than generated by *real-world events.
- Synthetic data is created algorithmically, and can be used as a stand-in for  test datasets of production data
- **Real data** does play a part in synthetic data generation - depending on how
realistic you want the output

### Problem

- A lack of useful test data hampers the development of new systems.
Cloning production data (if it exists) creates significant risks requiring
continued management with the headache of redacting PII data and continued
Compliance / Information Security oversight

- Sharing data with potential partners is problematic and data redaction
is not always the ideal solution as distributions in the data are still
exposed and is not friendly to work with – Anonymization is an expensive
involved process

## History

DataHub started in Citi's E4 program (Engineering Excellence 4), Citigroup's highest engineering excellence training program. DataHub originated from the 3rd iteration of the program in 2019.
