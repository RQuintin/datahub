# DataHub

```shell
pip install datahub_core
```

Datahub is a python library which helps you to produce synthetic datasets.
Datahub has a slant towards financial services, but for the most it is generic.

The core library is un-opinionated as to what you do with the generated data - it
simply gives you a pandas dataframe or an object list - what you do with that
dataset is up to you, Pandas for example has a vast array of support for persisitng
dataframes. That said, we are working on service and UI capabilities which of course
will persist data.

The core library will however remain as vanilla and un-opinionated as possible.

Many of the features of datahub are drawn from existing python libraies dedicated
to some facet of synthetic generation - Datahub while offering a lot of it's
own functionality directly pulls in other libraries where applicable.

## Overview of Synthetic data

- Synthetic data is information that's is artificially manufactured rather than
  generated by *real-world events.
- Synthetic data is created algorithmically, and can be used as a stand-in for
  test datasets of production data

*"Real data" does play a part in synthetic data generation - depending on how
realistic you want the output

## Getting started

First if you are behind a corporate firewall - or your corporate rules say you
have to use an internal pypi mirror , you need to configure your pip.ini file
with either your corporate proxy or set the index + index-url to your
internal mirror. More can be read [LINK] ## TODO ##

Simply run

```shell
pip install datahub_core
```

For more examples - look here [LINK] // TODO
